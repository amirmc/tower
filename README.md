# tower

**tower** binds values into templated web pages and produces a parallel
  directory hierarchy with the results.

To use **tower**, just

```
$ tower build
```

and your present working directory and descendents will be rendered into
`_site/`. You can also `tower build my_source_directory` and `tower
build src -o my_output_site`.
